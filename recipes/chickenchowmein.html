    <img src="../img/Chicken Chow Mein.jpeg" alt="Chicken Chow Mein">
    <p>In the West Indies we eat chicken chow mein with lots of chile.
    </p>
    <p>It's usually served with plain rice. This dish has tons of 
    flavor and is a bit different from what you'd get in a Chinese restaurant.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 chile peppers, chopped</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (1 1/2 inch) piece ginger root, cut into strips</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, cut into strips</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, cut into strips</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground white pepper</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 green onions, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>

            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chile peppers, onion, garlic, and ginger; cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 5 tablespoons dark soy sauce; fry for 1 more minute.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>
                Cook and stir chicken in the onion mixture over high heat until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes. Add green bell pepper and carrots and cook until softened, about 5 more minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>
                Gently fold noodles into chicken mixture. Mix in white pepper, 5 more tablespoons dark soy sauce, and cilantro until heated through, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with green onion to serve.
