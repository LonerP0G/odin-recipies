    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>2 (4 pound) whole chickens, cut up</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups ketchup</li>
        <li>¾ cup prepared mustard</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>¼ cup steak sauce</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons liquid smoke flavoring</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>12 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>3 cups prepared coleslaw (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Place chicken in a large pot with enough water to cover. 
                Bring to a boil, and cook until chicken comes off the 
                bone easily, about 3 hours. Make sauce while the chicken cooks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>
                In a saucepan over medium heat, mix together the 
                ketchup, mustard, brown sugar, garlic, honey, 
                steak sauce, lemon juice, and liquid smoke. 
                Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a gentle 
                boil, and simmer for about 10 minutes. 
                Set aside to allow flavors to mingle.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>
                When the chicken is done, remove all meat 
                from the bones, and chop or shred 
                into small pieces. Place in a pan 
                with the sauce, and cook for about 
                15 minutes to let the flavor of the 
                sauce soak into the chicken. Spoon barbequed 
                chicken onto buns, and top with coleslaw if you like.
